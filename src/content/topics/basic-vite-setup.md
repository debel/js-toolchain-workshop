## Coding time

It's time to start diving into the details of vite.

We'll start small - just introduce a basic vite setup and explore what it does out of the box.

In my experience, the best way to really understand how something work is to play around with it, observe what is actually happening, try stuff out, and read the docs and code.

You can either start from scratch and introduce vite manually in your current project, or checkout the [vanilla-vite example in the playground](https://github.com/debel/js-toolchain-workshop-playground/tree/main/vite-vanilla)
Alternatively, you can bootstrap a new vite based project using a pre-configured template.
