## Goals

- Understanding the modern JS toolchain
- Get familiar with (some of) the tools
- Create a small sample project

---

<class-note>

  The toolchain space is too broad.

  There are too many topics, tools and things to explore.

  We are not going to be able to cover everything..

## Non Goals

- No asset management
